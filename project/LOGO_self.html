    <h1 class="project-title">Self Identity Logo Design</h1>

    <div class="project-description">
      <p>This logo was designed as a personal identity mark, combining both my English and Chinese names. The letters V and L (Vincent Liu) can be read when viewed in one direction, while the same form also represents WL (Wenxi Liu) or WXL when interpreted differently. This flexible reading connects my English and Chinese identities within one unified design.

The logo went through six different concepts, from which the most recognizable version was selected through feedback from friends. That version was refined into three final variations. The finished mark also resembles the character 火 (“fire”), adding cultural symbolism of energy and speed. While originally developed as a personal mark, it could also adapt to business contexts such as a shoe store or other brand applications.</p>
