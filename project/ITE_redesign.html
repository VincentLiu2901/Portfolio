    <h1 class="project-title">Intelligent Tech Engine (ITE) Strategic Design Plan</h1>
         
    <div class="project-description">
      <p>The ITE Strategic Design Plan was created as part of an advanced design course project that challenged our team to connect design research, brand strategy, and creative communication into one unified document. ITE is envisioned as a technology integration platform for small- and medium-sized e-commerce businesses struggling with digital tool fragmentation.</p>
      
      <p>Many businesses today are overwhelmed by the growing number of digital tools—AI services, automation platforms, data dashboards, and APIs. While each tool is powerful, they often fail to integrate seamlessly. Our mission was to position ITE as the bridge between people and technology—a brand that simplifies complexity, builds trust, and makes technology feel human rather than intimidating.</p>
