    <h1 class="project-title">Aritzia Mobile App UX Research – Enhancing Mobile Fashion Experience</h1>
         
    <div class="project-description">
      <p>This comprehensive UX research project explores the potential of a mobile app for Aritzia, a leading Canadian fashion brand for young women (15–45). While Aritzia is successful in-store and online, the absence of a mobile app creates a competitive disadvantage compared to brands like H&M and Zara. Our research aimed to evaluate customer needs, identify pain points, and provide actionable recommendations for app development.</p>
      
      <p>The project was conducted by Liu, Wenxi (Vincent), Malhotra, Shivani, Nguyen, Dao (Hana), Tahiri, Anosha, and Yang, Dan, using a mixed-method approach that combined quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. Through extensive research and user testing, we identified key opportunities for enhancing customer experience and supporting Aritzia's business goals including increasing sales, boosting satisfaction, and strengthening brand recognition.</p>
